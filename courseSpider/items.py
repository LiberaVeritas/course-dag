        First I tried to use default_input_processor = TakeFirst(), but I realized that it was an array 
        again when went into the output_processor.
        I found an answer from https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46619150/scrapy-item-loader-default-processors :
            "It is written in this way:
            if processed_value: self._values[field_name] += arg_to_iter(processed_value). 
            After applying input process it is converted back to array so you can apply output processors. 
            As processors will assume input as an array only."
