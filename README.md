# McGill Course Map

## Find your path easily

### Features

People's interests vary, so do their degree paths.

McGill's website only shows what are prerequisites for a course but not where you can go after it. For those who are unsure about their future paths like me, possibilities matter. McGill Course Map comes to your aid.

It shows relationships between courses, so you can see all courses stemming from the one you are currently taking with information about term.

### Guide

**Path mode** 

![Path mode](demo_images/path-mode.PNG)

**Course info panel** provides the full name, credits, and terms offered of the one you clicked in the graph. You can go to the original page by clicking its name.

**Filters** filter out courses from certain subjects.

**Layout** changes the layout of nodes in the graph.

Examples:

It shows all courses from the subject you search. You can also see courses from other subjects that are relevant. For example, math 223 is a prerequisite for a lot of comp courses.

**Mini-map** shows which courses you can take JUST after the one you clicked. It's a breadth-first-search with depth limit 1. You can also go to the original page by clicking its name.

### How to run this app locally

1. `git clone https://github.com/Deerhound579/mcgill-course-map.git`

3. `pip install -r requirements.txt` installs all dependencies
4. `python app.py`

### How to run the spider

If you want to run the spider, you need to install dev dependencies by 

`pip install -r dev-requirements.txt`

In the project root directory, run `scrapy crawl courses`. All output data will be stored in `course_data` folder.
